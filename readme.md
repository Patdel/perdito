Perdito is an application that aims to bring commentary, history, and shared information about different places in NYC from people who like to rescue the rich past of the different corners of the city. These don't have to be part of a landmark presevation zone in order to be part of this microblog. Sometimes it can be a restaurant, a neighborhood or simply a store that people pass by without knowing the role it played in NYC's history, either its grand history or its small history. The aim is for people to identify a place, locate it, and add some information about it. Then another person can add something to it, initiating a thread of commentary that will turn the different pockets of built history into a vibrating urban environment.
